## Automatic-Light-Intensity-Controller-Torch

Introducing the Atmega328P-based Automatic Light Intensity Controller Torch, this innovative project employs the powerful capabilities of the Atmega328P microcontroller, programmed in assembly language, to create a responsive and energy-efficient lighting solution. The torch features a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure ambient light intensity, and the microcontroller dynamically adjusts the torch's LED brightness accordingly. By utilizing assembly language, the code is optimized for the specific architecture of the Atmega328P, ensuring efficient and precise control. This project not only demonstrates the versatility of assembly programming but also showcases the potential for creating intelligent, autonomous devices capable of adapting to environmental conditions for enhanced user experience and energy conservation.
